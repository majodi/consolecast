This repo contains open source example code and schematics for ConsoleCast, the Universal Serial to WIFI bridge development board.

ConsoleCast has on-board WIFI, RS232 and USB host capabilities. The factory loaded firmware features an on-board Terminal emulator. You can connect and "talk" to your serial device, like network equipment, measuring equipment, etc. over Wifi just by using your browser, no cable, no special software needed and platform independant.

Please see [consolecast.nickstick.nl](https://consolecast.nickstick.nl) for details.

Fully assembled boards are available also. Small batches are produced in cooperation with [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/), see [info here](https://consolecast.nickstick.nl/index.html#purchase).
